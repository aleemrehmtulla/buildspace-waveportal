# Frontend component to waveportal 👋

## Usage 🤝

This is based off the Rinkeby network (ETH Testnet)

You will need a wallet to interact with the smart contract, metamask is best

I have console.log showing it mining, also view the contract here: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x439cAd0AB0c5452F596c2DcCbfb2bF46b604dae4
